## 🔬 Cybersecurity Projects

### 🛡️ Network Traffic Analysis & Threat Detection
Captured live packets using Wireshark and analyzed protocols such as DNS, HTTP, TCP, and ARP to detect suspicious patterns and possible attacks like ARP spoofing and DNS anomalies.

**What I learned:**
- Deep packet inspection
- Identifying malicious traffic
- Understanding real network behavior

---

### 🔍 Network Scanning & Enumeration Lab
Performed scanning and enumeration of devices and services in a controlled lab environment using Nmap and Kali Linux tools.

**What I learned:**
- Port scanning techniques
- Service/version detection
- Identifying open attack surfaces

---

### 🌐 Web Application Vulnerability Testing (OWASP)
Tested vulnerable web applications in lab setups to understand SQL Injection, XSS, Authentication flaws, and insecure configurations.

**What I learned:**
- OWASP Top 10 practically
- Finding and understanding web vulnerabilities
- Basic exploitation workflow

---

### 🧪 TryHackMe Security Labs
Completed multiple rooms involving network services, enumeration, misconfigurations, and exploitation scenarios.

**What I learned:**
- Real attack methodology
- Enumeration to exploitation process
- Thinking like an attacker
